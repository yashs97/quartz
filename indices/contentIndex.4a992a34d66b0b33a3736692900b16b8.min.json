In order to meet these every increasing scaling needs, horizontal scaling of GPUs/TPUs is of utmost importance. There several paradigms to enable model training across multiple hardware accelerators.\n\nIn this series, I'll be mainly covering the following techniques:\n\n1. [Distributed Data Parallel](ddp)\n2. Full Sharded Data Parallel\n3.
